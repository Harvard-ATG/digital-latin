## Getting Started

### 1. Accessing the App
- Open the app in your browser at: [https://digital-latin.dev.tlt.harvard.edu/](https://digital-latin.dev.tlt.harvard.edu/)
- **Important:** You must be connected to the Harvard VPN to access this URL.
- The sidebar on the left is your main navigation and settings area.

### 2. Sidebar Navigation
- **Sidebar Visibility:**  
  On computers, the sidebar is usually visible. On mobile or small screens, it may be hidden.  
  If you don’t see the sidebar, hover your mouse in the upper left corner to reveal double arrows (>>) and click to open it.  
  **Tip:** Clicking the double arrows (<<) again will also close the sidebar.
- **New Session:**  
  Click "New Session" to start a fresh session. This will clear your chat and allow you to select a new level.
- **Level Selection:**  
  - Choose either **Level I** (first-year) or **Level II** (second-year) for your passage.
  - Once selected, the level is locked for the session. To change levels, start a new session.
  - It is best to create a new session for each new passage to avoid mixing contexts.
- **Session Management:**  
  - Your sessions are saved automatically.
  - You can review, load, or delete past sessions from the sidebar (if enabled).

## Using the Chat

### 1. Submitting a Passage
- Enter your Latin passage in the chat input area.
- Click the ➤ button to send your message.
- The assistant will respond with a simplified version and a breakdown of changes.

### 2. Follow-up Questions
- After submitting a passage, you can type your next passage or question, but you must wait for the assistant to finish responding before sending again.
- This ensures the AI has the correct context for your follow-up.

### 3. Level Selection Lock
- Once a level is chosen, it cannot be changed for the current session.
- To select a new level, start a new session.

## Visual Indicators
- **Thinking Icon:**  
  When the app is processing (e.g., saving, generating a response), a unique “thinking” icon appears in the upper right. This icon cycles through outdoor activity symbols (such as swimming, biking, and rowing) while the app is working. Please wait for it to disappear before your next action.
- **Sidebar on Mobile:**  
  On mobile, the sidebar may close automatically. Use the double arrows in the upper left to reopen it.

## Tips for Best Experience
- Streamlit (the app framework) is less reactive than some web apps. Use slow, intentional clicks and wait for the app to update before clicking again.
- If the app seems unresponsive, give it a moment to process.
- Always start a new session for a new passage to avoid context overlap.
- Your data is saved automatically, but if you close your browser or lose connection, your most recent changes may not be saved until your next action.
