# Streamlit UI Notes

## App Description (Updated)

This app is a Latin passage simplification assistant for instructors. It uses advanced language models to help Latin teachers simplify authentic classical Latin texts for students at different proficiency levels. The assistant follows detailed, level-specific instructions (from Jinja2 prompt templates) to rewrite Latin passages in a way that preserves all key ideas and context, while removing advanced grammatical structures that may be too difficult for the target student group. The app also provides references to trusted Latin grammar and vocabulary resources.

- **Level I**: Simplifies Latin passages for first-year students, focusing on basic grammar and vocabulary.
- **Level II**: Simplifies Latin passages for second-year students, avoiding advanced constructions and providing more nuanced simplification.

The app allows instructors to:
- Choose the simplification level (Level I or Level II) for their passage.
- Paste or enter a Latin passage and receive a simplified version, following strict pedagogical and grammatical guidelines.
- Review a detailed breakdown of the changes made to each sentence.
- Save, load, and manage past simplification sessions.

## Suggested Sidebar Text

## Components Added

- **Sidebar session management**: 
  - Past sessions are listed with session name and date (date in brackets, padded for alignment).
  - Delete button (trashcan) for each session, with tooltip "Delete Session".
  - Sidebar width increased for better readability.
- **System prompt selection**:
  - Uses Jinja2 templates for system prompts if available (`level1` and `level2`).
  - Falls back to `.md` files or default string if no Jinja template is found.
- **Chat rendering**:
  - User and assistant messages styled with custom backgrounds.
  - Assistant messages support bold (`*word*`) and bullet points (`* ...`).
  - Copy button for assistant messages (uses hidden textarea and JS).
- **Session save/load**:
  - Sessions can be saved and loaded from SQLite DB.
  - Session title and chat history are preserved.

## Challenges & Limitations

- **Streamlit Button Formatting**:
  - `st.button` does not support HTML or true multiline labels.
  - Workaround: pad session names with Unicode spaces and use `\n` to simulate new lines, but rendering is not always perfect.
  - Date is shown in brackets after the session name for clarity.
- **Duplicate Key Errors**:
  - Streamlit requires all widget keys to be unique. 
  - Solution: append `_btn` or similar suffixes to keys for session and delete buttons.
- **HTML in Buttons**:
  - `unsafe_allow_html` is not supported in `st.button`.
  - Tooltips (`help`) are used for extra info.
- **Copy Button for Assistant Messages**:
  - Uses a hidden `<textarea>` and JS to copy text (works in most browsers, but not all environments).
- **Jinja2 Prompt Templates**:
  - Jinja2 templates are loaded dynamically for system prompts.
  - Context can be injected if needed.
  - If no Jinja file is found, falls back to `.md` or default string.
- **Sidebar Layout**:
  - Custom CSS is used to increase sidebar width and improve layout.
  - Some limitations remain due to Streamlit's layout system.
- **Regex and Formatting Issues**:
  - Regex patterns for cleaning up message artifacts (e.g., trailing HTML from button rendering) can cause errors if not carefully escaped.
  - Unescaped parentheses or special characters in regex led to `re.error: unbalanced parenthesis` exceptions.
  - Formatting assistant messages with bold, bullets, and line breaks required repeated tuning.
- **Session List Duplicates**:
  - Accidentally rendering the session list twice in the sidebar led to duplicate session buttons.
  - Solution: ensure only one loop/block renders the session list.
- **Sidebar Session Label Alignment**:
  - Achieving consistent alignment and multiline display for session names and dates is difficult due to Streamlit's widget limitations.
  - Padding with Unicode spaces helps, but is not pixel-perfect and may not work with all fonts.
- **Streamlit Rerun and State Management**:
  - Use of `st.rerun()` to update UI after user input can make state management tricky, especially for chat history and session loading.
  - Ensuring session state is not lost or duplicated after reruns required careful logic.
- **Prompt File Selection**:
  - Ensuring the correct Jinja2 prompt is loaded for each level required filename pattern matching and fallback logic.
  - If multiple prompt files match, only the first is used.
- **Streamlit API Limitations**:
  - Some features (e.g., true multiline button labels, HTML in buttons, custom tooltips) are not natively supported.
  - Workarounds are sometimes brittle or visually inconsistent.

## Limitations of Streamlit Compared to React or JavaScript-Based Applications

- **Customization and Flexibility**: Streamlit is designed for rapid prototyping and data apps, but it is less flexible than React or other JavaScript frameworks for building highly customized UIs and complex interactive components.
- **Component Ecosystem**: React and JavaScript have a vast ecosystem of reusable UI components, libraries, and design systems. Streamlit's component library is limited, and while custom components can be built, it requires extra effort and often involves bridging Python and JavaScript.
- **Frontend Performance**: React apps can leverage advanced frontend optimizations, virtual DOM, and client-side rendering for smoother, more responsive UIs. Streamlit apps are server-driven and can feel less responsive, especially with frequent reruns or large data updates.
- **State Management**: Streamlit's state management is simple but can be limiting for complex workflows. React offers robust state management solutions (Redux, Context API, etc.) for handling complex, multi-component state.
- **Routing and Navigation**: Streamlit has very basic support for multipage apps, while React and JavaScript frameworks offer full-featured routing, nested navigation, and deep linking.
- **Animations and Transitions**: Streamlit has limited support for animations and transitions, whereas React and JavaScript libraries (like Framer Motion) provide rich animation capabilities.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Real-time, multi-user collaboration is much easier to implement in JavaScript-based apps using WebSockets or frameworks like Next.js, whereas Streamlit is primarily single-user per session.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: React and JavaScript frameworks offer fine-grained control over responsive design and mobile optimization. Streamlit apps are responsive to a degree, but customization is limited.
- **Integration with Frontend Tooling**: JavaScript apps can easily integrate with frontend build tools, testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines tailored for web development. Streamlit is more focused on Python and data science workflows.

**Summary:** Streamlit is excellent for quickly building data-driven apps in Python, but for highly interactive, visually rich, or large-scale web applications, React or JavaScript-based frameworks offer greater flexibility and control.

## To Do / Ideas

- Improve copy button reliability across all browsers.
- Consider using a custom component for more flexible sidebar layouts.
- Add more dynamic context to Jinja2 prompt rendering if needed.
- Explore better multiline support for session labels in the sidebar.

## UI/UX Tips

### (Optional) Make the Chat Container Narrower

If you want to reduce the width of the main chat container, add this to your app (before rendering chat):

```python
st.markdown("""
<style>
div.st.emotion-cache-1kyxreq, div.st-emotion-cache-1kyxreq, div.st-emotion-cache, div.st-emotion-cache-0 {{
    max-width: 740px !important;
    margin-left: auto !important;
    margin-right: auto !important;
}}
</style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

You may need to inspect your app in the browser to find the exact class name for your Streamlit version.

# Notes on Implementation, UI Decisions, and Streamlit Limitations

## Use of st.chat() (or st.chat_message)

As of July 2025, the codebase does **not** use `st.chat()` or `st.chat_message()` from Streamlit. Instead, it manually renders chat history using custom HTML and markdown2. This approach was chosen for full control over formatting and compatibility, but it is more complex and error-prone than using Streamlit's built-in chat components.

## Challenge: Updating the Chat Display with st.rerun()

A major challenge was updating the chat display after user input. Streamlit's `st.rerun()` (formerly `st.experimental_rerun()`) is used to force the script to restart and update the UI. However, due to Streamlit's single-script, top-to-bottom execution model, rerunning the script can make it difficult to manage state transitions and UI updates, especially for chat applications where you want to append messages rather than redraw the entire interface.

## How st.chat_message() Helps

The newer `st.chat_message()` API (sometimes referred to as `st.chat()` in documentation) is designed for chat UIs. It manages message history and incremental updates natively, reducing the need for manual rerun logic and custom HTML. Migrating to this API would simplify the code, make chat updates smoother, and better align with Streamlit's intended usage for conversational apps.

## July 2025: PostgreSQL Integration, DB Sidebar, and Preloaded Data

- **PostgreSQL Integration:**
  - Added support for PostgreSQL as a session backend, with all DB logic encapsulated in `src/session_db_postgres.py`.
  - Docker Compose now includes a PostgreSQL service, with credentials and DB name set via environment variables and `.env` file.
  - Entrypoint script (`entrypoint.sh`) ensures the database is ready, preloads dummy data, and then starts the Streamlit app.
  - Dockerfile now ensures `entrypoint.sh` is executable, automating setup for all contributors.

- **Session Sidebar (DB-Backed):**
  - The sidebar in both main and chatapi apps now loads and displays sessions directly from the PostgreSQL database.
  - File-based session sidebar code is commented out but preserved for future use or fallback.
  - All session management (save, load, delete) is now routed through the DB interface for consistency and production-readiness.

- **Preloaded Dummy Data:**
  - Added `src/load_dummy_sessions.py` to insert example sessions into the PostgreSQL DB for development and testing.
  - Entrypoint script runs this loader automatically on container startup, so the app always starts with sample data in the sidebar.
  - Dummy data is visible in the sidebar and can be loaded into the app for demonstration or testing.

- **Other Notes:**
  - All changes are documented in the README and changelog for team onboarding and transparency.
  - Temporary debug file logging is available in `session_db_postgres.py` to inspect what is being written to the DB (remove before production).

## Database Backend Toggle and Clean UI Architecture (July 2025)

- **Decision:** The application now supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL for session management, with a visual toggle in the Streamlit sidebar. This allows developers and users to switch between database backends at runtime for demonstration, development, or production needs.
- **Implementation:**
  - All database logic is encapsulated in `src/session_db_sqlite.py` and `src/session_db_postgres.py`, each exposing the same interface (e.g., `ensure_sessions_table`, `save_session`, `list_sessions`, `load_session`, `delete_session`).
  - The main Streamlit app files (`streamlit_ui_main.py`, `streamlit_ui_chatapi.py`) do not contain any direct database logic or SQL. Instead, they import the correct backend module based on the sidebar toggle and call its interface functions.
  - The toggle is implemented as a `st.sidebar.radio` widget, making the backend choice explicit and user-friendly.
- **Goal:**
  - Keep the UI code clean, backend-agnostic, and easy to maintain.
  - Enable quick switching and testing of different database backends without code changes or risk of breaking UI logic.
  - Make it easy for future contributors to add new backends or modify existing ones by only touching the backend modules.
- **Benefits:**
  - Facilitates local development (SQLite) and production deployment (PostgreSQL) from the same codebase.
  - Demonstrates best practices for separation of concerns and modularity in Streamlit apps.
  - Reduces risk of bugs and makes the codebase easier to onboard for new developers.


## Summary
- The current code uses manual chat rendering, not `st.chat_message()`.
- Updating the chat display with `st.rerun()` works but is clunky and can lead to state management issues.
- Using `st.chat_message()` would be a more robust and maintainable solution for chat UIs in Streamlit.


## export_sessions_to_markdown.py

**Purpose:**
This script exports chat sessions and their messages from the PostgreSQL database to individual Markdown (.md) files. Each file contains a readable transcript of a session, including metadata (session name, ID, timestamps) and all chat messages with timestamps and time deltas. This is designed for non-technical users to easily review or share session histories.

**How it works:**
- Connects to the database and fetches all sessions and their messages.
- Prompts the user for a start and end index (or accepts them as command-line arguments) to select which sessions to export.
- Creates a Markdown file for each selected session in the specified output directory (default: ../data/session_exports_md).
- Each file is named after the session and contains a readable chat log.

**Usage examples:**
- Run interactively (will prompt for range):
  python export_sessions_to_markdown.py
- Export a specific range:
  python export_sessions_to_markdown.py --start 0 --end 10
- Specify a custom output directory:
  python export_sessions_to_markdown.py --output_dir ./exports

See the script docstring for more details.

## Inspecting Your PostgreSQL Database in Docker

You can use either `docker-compose exec` or `docker exec` to access your running PostgreSQL container.  
**Choose the method that matches how you started your containers:**

---

### Option 1: Using `docker-compose exec` (recommended if you used Docker Compose)

1. **Open a shell in the postgres container:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec postgres bash
   ```
   - `exec`: Run a command in a running container.
   - `postgres`: The service name as defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.
   - `bash`: Start a bash shell.

2. **Connect to PostgreSQL using psql:**
   ```sh
   psql -U <username> -d <database>
   ```
   - `-U <username>`: Connect as the specified database user (e.g., `postgres`)
   - `-d <database>`: Connect to the specified database (e.g., `sessions`)
   - Example:  
     ```sh
     psql -U postgres -d sessions
     ```
   - You may be prompted for the password for the user you specify.

---

### Option 2: Using `docker exec` (if you started the container directly)

1. **Find your container name:**
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
   Look for a container with a name like `digital-latin-postgres`.

2. **Open a shell in the container:**
   ```sh
   docker exec -it digital-latin-postgres bash
   ```
   - `-i`: Interactive mode (keeps STDIN open)
   - `-t`: Allocates a pseudo-terminal (TTY) for shell access

3. **Connect to PostgreSQL using psql:**
   ```sh
   psql -U <username> -d <database>
   ```
   - `-U <username>`: Connect as the specified database user (e.g., `postgres`)
   - `-d <database>`: Connect to the specified database (e.g., `sessions`)
   - Example:  
     ```sh
     psql -U postgres -d sessions
     ```
   - You may be prompted for the password for the user you specify.

---

### Once Inside psql (applies to both methods)

#### To List Tables:
```sql
\dt
```
Example output:
```
           List of relations
 Schema |   Name    | Type  |  Owner
--------+-----------+-------+----------
 public | messages  | table | postgres
 public | sessions  | table | postgres
(2 rows)
```

#### To View All Data in the Sessions Table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sessions;
```
Example:
```
 id |     name      |         created_at         |         updated_at         |                data
----+---------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------------
  1 | Session 1     | 2024-07-08 22:00:00+00    | 2024-07-08 22:10:00+00    | {...}
```

#### To View All Data in the Messages Table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM messages;
```
Example:
```
 id | session_id |   role   |         content         |        timestamp
----+------------+----------+------------------------+--------------------------
  1 |     1      |  user    | bona fide              | 2024-07-08 22:01:00+00
```

#### To Exit psql:
```sql
\q
```

#### To Exit the Container Shell:
```sh
exit
```

## Notes on Session Data and Message Logging

For clarity and consistency, every session's data—when written to a JSON file—should always include a `messages` array, even if it's empty. This mirrors the database logic, where a session with no messages simply returns an empty result from the `messages` table.

- **Why include an empty array?**
  - Makes the data structure predictable for both humans and scripts.
  - Allows easy determination of whether a session has any messages.
  - Aligns with the DB model: no rows in `messages` table for a session = empty array in JSON.

- **Implementation:**
  - On session creation (before any chat), initialize `chat_messages` as an empty list in `st.session_state`.
  - When saving session data to a JSON file, always include a `messages` field (or map `chat_messages` to `messages`).
  - When logging messages, append to this array so the session object always reflects the current chat history.

- **Note on DB vs. JSON:**
  - In the database, messages are stored in a separate `messages` table, so the session row itself does not contain a `messages` array.
  - When exporting or saving to JSON, it's helpful to gather all messages for a session and include them as a `messages` array in the session object for human readability and portability.

- **Benefit:**
  This approach ensures that session data is always complete and human-readable, and that reviewing or exporting sessions is straightforward regardless of whether any messages have been sent.
