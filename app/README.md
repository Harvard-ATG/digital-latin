# Streamlit UI for Gemini Integration

This project provides a Streamlit-based frontend for interacting with the Gemini pipeline. It allows users to select models, set system prompts, engage in multi-turn interactions, and save sessions.

## Features
- **Model Selection**: Choose from a list of allowed models.
- **System Prompts**: Set predefined prompts for Level I and Level II Latin translations.
- **Multi-Turn Interaction**: Chat with the Gemini pipeline and view the conversation history.
- **Session Management**: Save and load user sessions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- `pip` installed

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Navigate to the `app` directory:
```bash
cd /Users/kevingray/codebase/harvard-atg/digital-latin/app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui_main.py
# or
streamlit run streamlit_ui_chatapi.py --server.port 8502
```

### 5. Access the UI
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

## Docker & Docker Compose

You can run both apps using Docker Compose. This will start both services, each on its own port (8501 and 8502), sharing the same code and database files.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Main app: http://localhost:8501
- Chat API app: http://localhost:8502

## Exposing Your App with ngrok

To share your local Streamlit app with others, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs):

1. **Install ngrok**
   - Download from https://ngrok.com/download or use Homebrew:
     ```sh
     brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
     ```
2. **Start your Streamlit app(s)** (see above)
3. **Expose your app**
   - In a new terminal, run:
     ```sh
     ngrok http 8501
     ngrok http 8502
     ```
   - ngrok will display a public forwarding URL (e.g., `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app`). Share this link to give others access.

For more details, see the [ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs).

## Docker Entrypoint Script Permissions

The `entrypoint.sh` script is automatically made executable during the Docker build process (see the Dockerfile). You do **not** need to run `chmod +x entrypoint.sh` manually. This ensures the script always runs correctly for all contributors and CI/CD environments.

## Example: Inspecting Your PostgreSQL Database from the Container

To view your tables and data directly from the running PostgreSQL container:

1. **Open a shell in the postgres container:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec postgres bash
   ```
2. **Connect to PostgreSQL using psql:**
   ```sh
   psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB
   # For your setup, typically:
   psql -U postgres -d sessions
   ```
3. **List tables:**
   ```sql
   \dt
   ```
4. **View all data in the sessions table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sessions;
   ```
5. **To exit psql:**
   ```
   \q
   ```
